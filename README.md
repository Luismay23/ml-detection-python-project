# ml-detection-python-project
This project was about detecting anomalies in 2 IoT devices in the N-BaIot dataset, which were refined into 2 cleaner datasets for Machine Learning models to train on. 

This was a group project. I was responsible for all of the code implementation, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

I focused on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and evaluation.
All data used in this project is synthetic and created for academic purposes.
